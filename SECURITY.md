# QzonMe Security Audit & Implementation

## 🚨 Critical Vulnerabilities Found & Fixed

### 1. **HARDCODED SECRETS** (FIXED ✅)
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Issue:** Cloudinary API credentials were hardcoded in source code  
**Fix:** Moved to environment variables with validation

### 2. **WEAK ADMIN AUTHENTICATION** (FIXED ✅)
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Issue:** Client-side only password check with hardcoded password  
**Fix:** Implemented JWT-based server-side authentication with bcrypt hashing

### 3. **UNAUTHORIZED DATA ACCESS** (FIXED ✅)
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Issue:** Admin routes accessible without authentication  
**Fix:** Added requireAdmin middleware to all sensitive endpoints

### 4. **INSUFFICIENT INPUT VALIDATION** (IMPROVED ✅)
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Issue:** Basic Zod validation without security considerations  
**Fix:** Enhanced validation with sanitization and strict patterns

### 5. **NO RATE LIMITING** (FIXED ✅)
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Issue:** APIs vulnerable to abuse and DoS attacks  
**Fix:** Implemented rate limiting on all creation endpoints

## 🔒 Security Measures Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT-based admin authentication
- ✅ Bcrypt password hashing
- ✅ Rate limiting on login attempts (15-minute lockout after 5 failed attempts)
- ✅ Admin middleware protection on sensitive routes
- ✅ Token expiration (24 hours)

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ Enhanced Zod schemas with security patterns
- ✅ HTML sanitization to prevent XSS
- ✅ Filename sanitization for uploads
- ✅ Strict character limits and allowed patterns
- ✅ SQL injection prevention through ORM usage

### Rate Limiting
- ✅ User creation: 5 per minute
- ✅ Quiz creation: 3 per minute
- ✅ Image uploads: 10 per minute
- ✅ Quiz attempts: 10 per minute
- ✅ Admin login: 5 attempts per 15 minutes

### Environment Security
- ✅ Database credentials in environment variables
- ✅ Cloudinary credentials moved to environment
- ✅ JWT secret configurable
- ✅ Admin credentials using bcrypt hashes

## 🛡️ Required Environment Variables

For production deployment, set these environment variables:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string

# Cloudinary (Image Storage)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Admin Authentication
ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_username
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=your_bcrypt_hash  # Use bcrypt to hash your password
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_minimum_32_chars

# Optional
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_google_analytics_id
```

## 🔧 Security Configuration Steps

### 1. Generate Admin Password Hash
```bash
# Use Node.js to generate a bcrypt hash
node -e "const bcrypt = require('bcrypt'); console.log(bcrypt.hashSync('your_admin_password', 10));"
```

### 2. Generate JWT Secret
```bash
# Generate a secure random string
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'));"
```

### 3. Update Environment Variables
Set all required environment variables in your deployment platform.

## 🚫 Security Restrictions Now Enforced

### Quiz Access Control
- ✅ Users can only view their own quiz dashboards via dashboard tokens
- ✅ Quiz access codes are validated before granting access
- ✅ Expired quizzes (7+ days) are automatically rejected
- ✅ No cross-user data access possible

### Admin Panel Security
- ✅ Server-side JWT authentication required
- ✅ Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- ✅ Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ Admin routes protected by middleware

### File Upload Security
- ✅ File type validation (images only)
- ✅ File size limits (10MB maximum)
- ✅ Filename sanitization
- ✅ Temporary file cleanup
- ✅ Cloudinary integration for secure storage

### API Security
- ✅ Input validation on all endpoints
- ✅ Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- ✅ Error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- ✅ CORS configuration (if needed)

## 🎯 Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Going Live:
- [ ] Set all environment variables
- [ ] Generate and set secure ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH
- [ ] Generate and set secure JWT_SECRET (32+ characters)
- [ ] Verify Cloudinary credentials are set
- [ ] Test admin login functionality
- [ ] Verify rate limiting is working
- [ ] Test file upload security
- [ ] Confirm database connection security
- [ ] Enable HTTPS in production
- [ ] Configure proper CORS headers
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging

### Database Security Notes:
- Database uses Neon PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- All queries use Drizzle ORM (prevents SQL injection)
- No raw SQL queries in codebase
- Connection string secured in environment variables

## 🔍 Ongoing Security Maintenance

### Regular Tasks:
- Monitor login attempts and patterns
- Review uploaded content periodically
- Update dependencies regularly (npm audit)
- Monitor database performance and connections
- Review server logs for unusual activity

### Monthly Reviews:
- Check for new security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Review and rotate JWT secrets if needed
- Audit admin access logs
- Review rate limiting effectiveness

## 🚨 Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:
1. Immediately rotate JWT_SECRET environment variable
2. Check server logs for unusual activity
3. Review recent admin login attempts
4. Consider temporarily increasing rate limits
5. Verify database integrity
6. Check Cloudinary usage for unusual uploads
